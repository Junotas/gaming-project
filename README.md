# ðŸŽ® Gaming Site

Welcome to my gaming website! Here, Iâ€™ll be building and adding a collection of small games over time, such as Snake, Tic-Tac-Toe, and more. Each game is designed for quick, casual fun and showcases different coding techniques.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Run the following commands to clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, install dependencies, and start the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Junotas/gaming-project.git
cd gaming-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to explore the games!

> **Note**: The local server address may vary. `http://localhost:5173` is the default but could differ based on your setup.

Enjoy playing, and keep checking back for new additions!
